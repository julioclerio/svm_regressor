# Learning Prediction Challenge using SVM and Regression Models

This project aims to predict learning through a challenge applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression and exploring other models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Regression Tree to find the best results.

## Project Overview

The challenge involves building a machine learning model to predict learning based on a provided dataset. Various regression models were applied to determine the most effective model for predicting learning outcomes.

### Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and result evaluation. Each regression model has a dedicated notebook for analysis and implementation.

- **Dataset:** The `dataset` folder contains the CSV file with the necessary data for training and testing the regression models.

- **Repository:** This folder contains the data dictionary in Markdown format, describing the meaning of each column present in the dataset.

## Applied Models

- **SVM for Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Regression Tree**

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. The notebooks can be executed in a platform that supports Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to load the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary (`repository/data_dictionary.md`) provides information about each variable present in the dataset. This includes descriptions, data types, and any other relevant information to understand the columns.

## Results Achieved

The results of the models are presented in the corresponding notebooks, highlighting metrics such as MSE, RÂ², and MAE to assess the performance of each model on the test data.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the respective directories to access the Jupyter notebooks and the dataset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julioclerio/svm_regressor
# Run the Jupyter notebooks
